**Objective:** To predict employee attrition and identify key factors influencing turnover to enable proactive retention strategies.

**Dataset:** The project utilized a comprehensive dataset containing various employee attributes and historical attrition records, including demographics, job role, and performance metrics.

**Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SHAP.

**Project Activities & Methodology:** I performed **data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, followed by **feature engineering** to enhance predictive power. I then trained and evaluated **machine learning classification models** (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Random Forest), optimizing them through **cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning**. **Model interpretability** using SHAP was applied to explain predictions and identify key attrition drivers.

**Benefits:** This project enables organizations to anticipate employee departures, facilitating timely interventions and targeted retention programs, thereby reducing recruitment costs and improving workforce stability.
